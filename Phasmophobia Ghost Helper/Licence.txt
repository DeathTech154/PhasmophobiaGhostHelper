Please do not copy any of the code for your own usage in part or full.
Please do not make any derrived software for public release.

You are welcome to tweak parts of the software but not if you are going to display that publicly
as I do not want people thinking the tool is buggy because you can't program.

If you have any edits you want to add officially:
Please go to the github (https://github.com/DeathTech154/PhasmophobiaGhostHelper/) and post a fork or suggest an edit and I will make sure it is sound..

Do not edit the software to remove the watermark at the top.
Do not redistribute unless express permission is given.

You are welcome to use this software royalty free in youtube videos, streaming,...
Although if you are going to display this software publically. Again do not remove the watermark.
If you are a creator it is a term of service that you display the software including watermark on your video/stream.

If you do wish to use the software and would like the watermark removed.
Please contact me via the above mentioned user accounts for twitter, twitch or youtube respectively.

The reason for the watermark is to give me something in return for the software released freely to all.
Sadly I have to make something out of it so this is done with a watermark for creators.
