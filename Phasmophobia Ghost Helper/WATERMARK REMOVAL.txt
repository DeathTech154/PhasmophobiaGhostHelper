If you do wish to use the software and would like the watermark removed.
Please contact me via the above mentioned user accounts for www.twitch.tv/deathtech154 - @deathtech154 - www.youtube.com/user/deathtechdb.

The reason for the watermark is to give me something in return for the software released freely to all.
Sadly I have to make something out of it so this is done with a watermark for creators.
If you are a creator it is a term of service to use the software that you display it on your video / stream.
This is to avoid confusion and promote the tool to keep it free for everyone.

The watermark (Containing my twitch, twitter and youtube handles) is there to promote my things.
In return the software is free to use for all.

So to have it removed please contact me and we will find a mutually acceptable solution.
